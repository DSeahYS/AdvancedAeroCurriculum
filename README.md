# SpaceWiki

SpaceWiki is a comprehensive educational compendium dedicated to advanced topics in astrodynamics, general relativity, and the emerging role of artificial intelligence in aerospace engineering. Designed as an interactive web-based resource, it serves as a hub for students, researchers, and professionals seeking in-depth knowledge across multiple academic levels.

## Purpose

The project aims to provide structured, accessible content covering foundational concepts to cutting-edge research in space sciences. It bridges the gap between theoretical physics and practical aerospace applications, with a special focus on the transformative impact of AI technologies in the field.

## Structure

SpaceWiki is organized into several interconnected HTML pages:

- **Hub (index.html)**: The main landing page featuring an interactive Three.js visualization of a black hole with accretion disk, navigation to all sections, and overview cards for each curriculum level.
- **Undergraduate Studies (undergrad.html)**: Covers fundamental concepts including orbital mechanics (Vis-Viva equation, Hohmann transfers) and special relativity.
- **Graduate Studies (grad.html)**: Explores advanced topics such as general relativity, perturbation theory, and black hole thermodynamics.
- **PhD & Research (phd.html)**: Delves into frontier areas like cosmology, quantum field theory, and numerical relativity.
- **Autonomous Horizons (ai_aerospace.html)**: A special report on the operationalization of AI in aerospace (2024–2025), covering neuromorphic computing, reinforcement learning for guidance/navigation/control, swarm intelligence, and AI applications in astrophysics.

## How to View

Since SpaceWiki consists of static HTML files, simply open `index.html` in any modern web browser to access the full site. The pages include interactive 3D visualizations powered by Three.js and mathematical equations rendered via MathJax, requiring an active internet connection for proper functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content
- **CSS3**: Styling and responsive design
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Interactivity and dynamic content
- **Three.js**: 3D graphics and simulations
- **MathJax**: Mathematical notation rendering
